<h1 class="heading">How To Conserve Household Water</h1>
<p align="justify" class="para1">Only flush when needed. A toilet is not a wastepaper
 basket for tissues, cotton balls or other bits of trash.Check for leaky facets and toilets. It is easy to replace worn 
 washers and since a small leak can waste many gallons of water a day, it is well worth the effort to test for leaks now.</p>

<p align="justify" class="para1">You use water every day at home. Brushing your teeth, washing out your milk glass,
 taking a shower or bath—all of these activities use water. But water is a limited resource. 
 We Californians can’t afford to waste even small amounts of water. You can help save California’s
 water by changing the way you use water inside and outside your home. And, the more you know, 
 the more you can help your mom and dad and other grown-ups remember to save water everyday.

<h4 class="heading">Water security and climate change</h4>
<p align="justify" class="para1">Freshwater is a scarce resource. Only 2.5 per cent of the 1.4 billion km3 of water
 on Earth is freshwater fit for human consumption, and most of this is inaccessible — nearly 70 per
 cent is locked up in glaciers, snow and ice. Our greatest source of freshwater is the 8 million km3 
 of groundwater, with only 0.3 per cent of freshwater (105,000 km3) being found in rivers, streams and lakes.</p>

<h2>THE FINAL WORD</h2>
<p align="justify" 	> Like so many things in life, the use of water can be a mindless process mired in habit. 
After all, you turn on the faucet and there it is: fresh, clear water. Alas, the availability 
of water may be a problem following a disaster. If you are lucky, you will at least have some 
water and if not, well, hopefully you will have plenty of water stored away and you will have 
learned in advance to be frugal in its use.While most of the tips outlined today apply to a situation normal
 – after all, a bubble bath would be out of the question following a disaster – they are still useful in that 
 they get you into the proper mindset of paying attention and being aware of the importance of water for
 you daily living needs.</p>
